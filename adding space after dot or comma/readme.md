# adding space after dot or comma in LATEX

It is a mistake I frequently make to forget to put spaces after periods and commas, especially in programs that do not control errors like latex.
As the size of the file grows, it becomes more and more difficult to find these errors.
I wrote a very simple code that uses RE to deal with it.


The code takes the file "simple.tex" as input, and creates another file named "fixed.tex" as output.
